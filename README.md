Harsh Patel — Full Stack Engineer | Backend & AI Systems

Full Stack Engineer focused on building scalable web applications and AI-powered systems.
I work across the MERN stack, TypeScript, Fastify, and microservice architectures, with a strong foundation in C++, Python, and systems design.

Experience includes developing with LLMs, GenAI, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, and agentic architectures using LangGraph and OpenAI/Gemini APIs.

Currently building AtlasHQ, a SaaS platform with real-time chat, AI agents, and CRM-oriented workflows. Deep focus on database design, distributed microservices, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Interests: scalable backend systems, orchestration layers for AI, and intelligent apps that blend traditional engineering with modern AI capabilities.
